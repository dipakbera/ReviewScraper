While you compare the previous versions of Iphone 6 and 6s, this is way ahead in terms of memory, speed and multitasking.

Battery juice is 2 to 3 hrs more and the Camera clarity is the best of all. You get the best of shots like a 21 mp digicam. Overall it is a..."

The new black colour also looks great. Yes, it is expensive but with the cash back offers on the pre-order units, it worked out to around 5k more than the US price (including taxes). That is the cost I guess for the Indian warranty and peace of mind.Also, flipkart being flipkart, it attempted delivery of the phone the next day after it was released which was great."

5ffa935e2ba19a0bcc04077d,Arif Iqbal Rana, Kota,"Feb, 2019",5,Must buy!,"It is a great product from apple. But not a complete value for money. Other brands provide much more at this price range. It is way too expensive. But if you're looking to buy this, it surely means that money doesn't matter more than apple product, right? If you're a fan of apple, then I would recomend it to you. Otherwise for normal consumers, it's not the one. I love the camera in this phone. However the battery life is pathetic on this one. Can't trust it. Performance is nearabout average."

Fast and the best part about it is that  one can use internet for the apps we use. The latest iOS had issues which were quickly resolved. Camera is good and way better than android . Except for apps like m-Indicator and Ridlr which have less features as compared to android apps.

I used to think that apple products are absolutelt flawless and they would never hang etc.But I turned out to be wrong.In the first 3 months of use, i had to force restart the phone a couple of times and there have been times when the phone behaved funnily.So it isnt perfect after all.But yes, it is smoother than most android phones. But it has its own flaws, which makes me wonder if it makes sense to pay such a huge premium."

5ffa93682ba19a0bcc0407cc,Imon roy, Kolkata,10 months ago,5,Highly recommended,Been using this phone for a while now and just upgraded from my IPhone SE. To be honest even this 4.7 inch model I find a little bit but given I am a one hand user . But content consumption is very good when compared to iPhone SE. display clarity is very good even though the resolution isn’t that much. The phone is snappy and doesn’t at all feel like a 3 year old phone. Even if it was 2022 I would have bought it.

5ffa936e2ba19a0bcc040811,Mohit Kumar, Bangalore,"Jan, 2020",5,Simply awesome,"Well, what can one say about an Apple product. It is an amazing product with excellent features and build quality. The camera is great and the display is superb. No questions asked about the quality of processor too as it has never hanged for me. Works very smoothly and hasn’t slowed down a bit. The only downside is the battery backup which is 10 hours at best at moderate use and also the ROM gets exhausted after a while. Nevertheless a great product!"

Reason for me to upgrade from a iPhone SE to iPhone 7 was purely due to form factor. I needed a slightly bigger screen but not as giant as 6inch and above. 4.7 inch is an apt size. Being water resistant too adds to the advantage. iOS by far has to be the best operating system amongst smartphones.Hoping that iOS supports this device for at least two years. ✌🏼"

Hence no issues on that sideBut if you are moving from Android to Apple then you will have bad experience because- The screen size is small hence you cannot enjoy YouTube and games- If you see Antutu benchmark score it is like a mid-range Android phone because this phone is 2016 generation phone and 2018 Android mid-range which costs 14k to 15k  beats this phone easily- Biggest drop back is no back button. Hence while watching ...

Primarily I had bought it for iOS, because I wanted security of my data so that I can safely use banking/Wallets Apps. Once you are used to iOS under interface, you will love the ease of operation of Apps. If you can't afford the Apple phones, take this advice - buy previous version few months after release of new version. Believe me you will save more than half !!"

Yes, iPhone 7 plus is better but it is much bigger size to conveniently use and isn't as handy. Apple lives up to its reputation yet again and provides quality and reliability.

Everyone should at least experience apple once. I am still user of android, but apple is altogether a different level. Reading experience is like reading in kindle which no android phone can give.

5ffa938a2ba19a0bcc04090c,Indranil Sengupta, Kolkata,"Jul, 2017",4,Performing = Awesomeness but have some suggestions as well.,I have been using iphone5s for the past 2 years. Switched to 7 very recently after 3 weeks of usage here are my observations:1. No problems in User interface. No problems related to performance. It is simply amazing.2. Iphone 5s was provided with a 2.1 Amp charger output. I am not sure why iphone 7 came with a 1Amp charger.3. The headphone come with a lightning connector. So it means you cannot listen to songs or do a meeting using headphones while charging it. Or the other way round.Ove...

Not much different from the earlier model but the black colour looks nice. Camera has improved in terms of low light performance but still feel S7 Edge has the best camera.

Yet to test the lightning earphones.Overall a worthy upgrade.

There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important.

5ffa94142ba19a0bcc040df1,Sameer Malik, New Delhi,"Dec, 2016",3,Nice,Gud phone in all aspects. But no screen protection. Eveñ after paying so much money ... Screen cracked falling from only 1.5 feet height ... Then why the hell its so costly... Just for a having a apple logo?. Even chienese phones have better screen protection technology than this. Screen replaced ... In 13000/-.

5ffa94142ba19a0bcc040df7,Rajeev Mansukhani, Mumbai,"May, 2017",1,terrible phone and customer service,The Iphone is heating up from day 1. this is the first time I have bought a I Phone. Totally disappointed.Also I have asked them to pick up the phone and they has asked me to call apple customer care center. I dont think Flipkart understands online return policies. Their website does not have a return button next to your order log. We have to email them. I wonder if they are just trying to dispose off the defected pieces during the sale period.

Went to service centre, contacted Apple support,escalted the issue for 2months but no use. They are simply telling that battery is good only. Battery draining in 12hours without any use is asusual. Apple is cheating us by selling worthless products. Flipkart should look on to it."
